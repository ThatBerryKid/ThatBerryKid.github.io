  <h1>JW's First Site!</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>This right here is going to be the best site practice coming back  any one has ever seen!</p>
  <p>So there seems to be some cool new features added to
    <bold>Dreamweaver</bold>
    which I think I <i>Love</i>, lol.</p>

	<h1>Progress!</h1>
  <p>Look at me, adding things to my website like I never skipped a beat! I've been creating for a while of course but this is awesome!</p>
  <p>At the time of writing this, my phone is next to me with a live update feed of the finished website, which is cool to me and a brand new experience for web designing!</p>
  <p><b>Never</b> before was I able to have my website <i>literally</i> refesh right in front of my eyes! It was usually a manuel process where after every major change, I would refresh the local page. Adobe Dreamweaver has gone to limits previously thought of only in actual dreams. This is a very powerful tool now! Happy to be back!</p>
